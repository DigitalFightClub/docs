# The Drop

If you're new to the NFT space - welcome! If you're not, then you've certainly seen or been a part of a "bad drop." Nothing is worse for a project than getting off on the wrong foot, with that in mind we set a few hard rules for our drop: 

* No gas wars
* No bonding curve
* Max 10 fighters per transaction
* Instant reveal

## What token standards are we using?

We will be utilizing the latest and greatest: [`ERC-1155`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)  
This enables users, within the DFC metaverse,  gas efficient transactions when interacting with your NFT Fighters \($DFC\) and your $TKO balances.   
  
Our NFT Fighters will be designed to be [`ERC-721`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) backward compatible. 

## What network is DFC launching on?

DFC will be launching on the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) \(Matic\) network for "The Drop" \(minting\) and all other DFC metaverse interactions: training, fighting, wearables, and recruiting.

We are considering launching on Ethereum's mainnet as well. Stay tuned for more details.  
This will be bridged via Polygon's [`PoS Bridge`](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/pos/getting-started/).  

## What marketplaces? OpenSea?

Yes, your NFT fighters will be fully compatible with [`OpenSea's marketplace`](https://opensea.io/). 

## Wallet?

\`\`[`MetaMask`](https://metamask.io/)\`\`

## How much is an NFT Fighter?

"The Drop" will be priced at 0.05 ETH per fighter.   
9,999 NFT Fighters capped at the initial drop sale.   
More fighters can be recruited at a later date. See [Recruiting](recruiting.md)

## $DFC? $TKO?

DFC has two tokens. An NFT \(non-fungible token\) and a fungible token.   
The NFT is your actual fighter. The fungible token will act as in-game currency that's needed to interact with your fighter and other fighters.
