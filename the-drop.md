# ðŸ’§ The Drop

If you're new to the NFT space - welcome! We're happy to help with any questions you have as some of these concepts may be foreign to you - [Discord](https://discord.gg/nBKSGkeHbP) is the best place to get those answered. And our [Mint Guide](mint-guide.md) is a great place to start.

## How much is an NFT Fighter?

The first generation of DFC Fighters cost .05 ETH each.

## $DFC? $TKO?

DFC has two tokens. An NFT ([non-fungible token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible\_token)) and a [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) token. \
The NFT is your actual fighter. The fungible token will act as in-game currency that's needed to interact with your fighter and other fighters. \
\
**NFT - ERC-721**\
**Token Name**: Digital Fight Club\
**Token Symbol**: $DFC\
\
**In-game Currency - ERC-20**\
**Token Name:** Digital Fight Coin\
**Token Symbol**: $TKO

## What token standards are we using?

We will be utilizing the latest and greatest: [`ERC-1155`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)\
This enables users, within the DFC metaverse, _gas efficient transactions_ when interacting with your NFT Fighters ($DFC) and your $TKO balances. \
\
Our NFT Fighters will be designed to be [`ERC-721`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) backward compatible.&#x20;

## What network is DFC launching on?

DFC will be launching and building on the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (Matic) network.\
This will be bridged via Polygon's [`PoS Bridge`](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/pos/getting-started/). &#x20;
