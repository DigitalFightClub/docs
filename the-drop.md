# The Drop

If you're new to the NFT space - welcome! If you're not, then you've certainly seen or been a part of a "bad drop." Nothing is worse for a project than getting off on the wrong foot, with that in mind we set a few hard rules for our drop: 

* No gas wars
* No bonding curve
* Max 10 fighters per transaction
* Instant reveal

_Need a lot more detail here, talk about actual drop mechanics \(Swezey stuff\) and $DNC tokens._

## What token standard are we using?

We will be utilizing the latest and great. [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)  
This enables the DFC metaverse gas efficient transactions when interacting with your NFT Fighters \($DFC\) and your $DNC balances. 

## What network is DFC launching on?

DFC is targeting the Polygon \(matic\) network.
