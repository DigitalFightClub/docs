# ðŸ¥Š Puncher's Chance Promise

We've designed our fight algorithm to be as realistic as possible. Every Fighter will have at least a "puncher's chance" to win the fight. The odds may be long, but your Fighter will never lose the fight before even stepping into the octagon.

We understand this portion of the project is critical for success, which is why we're devoting serious resources to get this right. We also hope you understand why we need to keep this aspect of our project relatively private. It would ruin the game if our fight algorithm were to be cracked.&#x20;

Because of this, everyone who is (and will be) working on the fight algorithm **will not** be able to own a Fighter. As much as we would love to play, we don't want to give the perception of any unfair advantage.&#x20;
