# Training & Sparring

## Training

Queue the Rocky training montage, it's time for your fighter to put in some work. Burn your [**$DFC**](usddfc-in-progress.md) tokens to initiate a training session which has a chance to upgrade a selected [**Trait**](traits.md)**.**

## **Sparring**

Similar to Training, Sparring is an opportunity to improve your fighter. The main difference in Sparring is that you choose another fighter in your gym for some quality time. Use your [**$DFC**](usddfc-in-progress.md) ****tokens to initiate a sparring session between two fighters for a chance to upgrade a [**Skill**](skills.md).

Sparring is the _only_ way to increase a particular fighters [**Skill**](skills.md). Choose a sparring partner wisely! If a sparring partner has a higher skill level on the skill you're trying to focus on the chance of your fighter progressing is greatly improved.

It's not impossible for a fighter to improve a skill if sparring with a partner with the same \(or lower\) skill level - just less likely.
