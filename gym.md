If you have a wallet, congrats - you have a Gym! (Although a Gym with no [**Fighters**](the-fighters/) is a lonely Gym) Think of the Gym page as your personal home page for all things DFC. You Gym page will show you a ton of information - not limited to:&#x20;

* Current $TKO Balance
* \# of Active Fighters & Retired Fighters
* Fight Record

Your Gym page is the launching point for all things Digital Fight Club. From here you select your Fighters and send them into Training, Sparring or into the octagon.&#x20;
