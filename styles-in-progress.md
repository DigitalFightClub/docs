# Styles

The 24 unique Styles add a strategy element to the game. Study your opponents strengths and weaknesses. Research what styles they've used in the past. Pick a style that not only counters your opponent's style but one that also plays to your strengths. The right style matchups can turn the tables on what may look like a one-sided fight at first glance.
