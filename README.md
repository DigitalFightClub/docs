# ðŸ‘Š Digital Fight Club

Welcome to the Digital Fight Club (DFC) - our mission is to build the #1 P2E strategy game.&#x20;

We're giving you the keys to your very own MMA Gym - allowing you to [**Train**](training-and-sparring.md), **** [**Spar**](training-and-sparring.md), [**Recruit**](recruiting.md) and [**Fight**](fighting.md) **for ETH**.

It's your job to put your Fighters in the best position through training, sparring, style & opponent selection. Once that is set, it's up to your Fighter to finish the job (with some help from our fight algorithm). _You will not have any specific control over your Fighter once the fight starts._&#x20;

While initially the DFC will be a text-based game - our endgame is to have an arena in {insert your favorite metaverse} where everyone can come watch their Fighters match up "live."
