# ðŸ’ª The Fighters

There are 9,999 genesis Fighters that will begin the Digital Fight Club. These will **only be minted directly** from our site - [Digital Fight Club](https://digitalfightclub.io).  After that, all secondary sales will take place on [approved marketplaces](../the-drop.md#current-marketplaces).

When you mint a Fighter, they will automatically be assigned [**Traits**](traits.md) & [**Skills**](skills.md)**.** Some of these you'll be able to improve, some of these will be locked. Minting a genesis Fighter will also give you 100 [**$TKO**](../usddfc-in-progress.md) tokens per Fighter which will be used in [**Training** & **Sparring**](../training-and-sparring.md)**.**

****[**Traits**](traits.md), [**Skills**](skills.md) and [**Styles**](../styles.md) all work together for each fight. A basic example, if a fighter has relatively low Reflex (trait), Power (trait), and Kickboxing (skill) we wouldn't recommend selecting a [**Style**](../styles.md) along the lines of {Counter Strike}. Not to say it's impossible for a Fighter to win going down this path, but a lot has to break in their favor.

Fighters will ultimately be split up across multiple [organizations and weight classes](../rankings.md) to compete in. If a Fighter starts tearing it up in one organization, don't be surprised if they get called up to the next division to compete for even bigger prizes.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Phase 5 we will introduce a [**Recruiting**](../recruiting.md) mechanic that will bring new fighters into the mix, but we've planned for there to be real in-game benefits for genesis Fighters.
