# ðŸ‘¤ Traits

Fighters join their Gyms with specific traits. Some are mutable (open to change), some are immutable (cannot be changed). Some are visible, **some are hidden** (no you can't see the hidden ones - that's part of our [**Puncher's Chance Promise**](../punchers-chance-promise.md)).

### **General Traits**

| Trait        | Description                                                                | Mutability |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Name         | Generated randomly based on your fighters country of origin.               | Immutable  |
| Origin       | Generated randomly from population statistics across all countries.        | Immutable  |
| Height       | Generated randomly based on average height statistics.                     | Immutable  |
| Weight       | Generated randomly based on average weight statistics.                     | Mutable    |
| Gender       | Generated randomly                                                         | Immutable  |
| Gym          | Gym that the fighter is a member of.                                       | Mutable    |
| Recruited On | Date the fighter first joined a gym.                                       | Immutable  |
| Retired      | Date the fighter decided to stop getting punched in the face for a living. | Immutable  |
| Record       | Fight record across all professional bouts.                                | Mutable    |

### Fighting Traits

Fighting traits are all mutable and can be improved through a successful [**Training**](../training-and-sparring.md) session.
