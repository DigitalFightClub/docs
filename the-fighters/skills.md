# ðŸ¥‹ Skills

Fighters enter a Gym with a particular set of skills; skills they have acquired over their short career. Skills that make them _potentially_ a nightmare for other fighters. **All skills are visible and mutable.**\
\
Skills can be improved upon through a successful [**Sparring**](../training-and-sparring.md) session.
