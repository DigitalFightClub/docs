# $TKO

$TKO is the Digital Fight Club's currency token. We have big ambitions for the $TKO token - including cosmetic wearables for your fighters. The initial plan for $TKO tokens will be for use in the [**Training & Sparring**](training-and-sparring.md) mechanics. $TKO tokens can be used to improve your fighter's [**Skills** ](skills.md)and ****[**Traits**](traits.md).

Each one of the first 9,999 fighters minted will also grant you 100 $TKO tokens. You will have the ability to earn additional $TKO through game progression and entering in fights. 

We will also hold back some $TKO tokens for giveaways \(largely driven by community votes\). _$_TKO _token supply will not be limited._ We plan for 2-5% inflation YoY - but this may change depending on community demand.
