# Recruiting

Ready to bring some new blood into your gym? Choose two retired fighters from your gym to go back to one of their home countries \(randomly selected\) and bring a fresh recruit back with them. The longer you allow them to scout, the better chance they'll bring back a quality fighter.

A few variables are in play here:

* Age of the recruiters matter - the "older" the fighter the better their eye for talent. They've been around the longest, they've seen it all, so they know what they're looking for. Everything else held equal, _**OG fighters will be the best recruiters.**_ 
* Recruiter's skillset plays a role. For example, if you send two recruiters who rank high in Wrestling, they have much better odds to find you a solid wrestler than they do finding you a quality karate recruit.
