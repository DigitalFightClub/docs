# ðŸ©¸ Recruiting

Ready to bring some new blood into your gym? Choose two retired Fighters from your Gym to go back to one of their home countries (randomly selected) and bring a fresh recruit ([**Fighter**](the-fighters/)) back with them.&#x20;

A few variables are in play here:

* Age of the recruiters matter - the "older" the Fighter the better their eye for talent. They've been around the longest, they've seen it all, so they know what they're looking for. Everything else held equal, _**genesis Fighters will be the best recruiters.**_&#x20;
* Recruiter's skillset plays a role. For example, if you send two recruiters who rank high in Wrestling, they have much better odds to find you a solid wrestler than they do finding you a quality Karate recruit.

The cost of recruiting is still TBD - we want to keep the cost relatively low to encourage new players to enter the game.
