# 🏆 Tournaments

While the current game workflow doesn't incorporate - we love the thought of creating bracket-style tournaments. The sky is really the limit here regarding the fun we can have. Tournaments for:

* Retired Fighters only
* Retired champion Fighters only
* Fighters from a specific origin
* Fighters across different weight classes
* Only Fighters named Steve
