# üõç Wearables

You mean you don't like 'Red Shirt' 'Blue Shirt?' While further down on the list, once we've crowned our first few DFC Champions we're going to turn our efforts to a wearables marketplace.

We've designed DFC Fighters from the beginning with this capability in mind. We'll welcome and encourage artists from both inside and outside the community to create new "gear" for DFC Fighters that you'll be able to purchase/win and equip on your Fighters. Here is the gear that will be available in the marketplace:

* Tops
* Bottoms
* Gloves
* Shoes
* Tattoos?&#x20;
