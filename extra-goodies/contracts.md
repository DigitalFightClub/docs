# ðŸ“„ Contracts

Contracts - like [**Wearables**](wearables.md) **** - are a little further down the list but will play a key role in the permanent DFC ecosystem.

Contracts are a versatile tool that will allow Gym owners to get value out of their Fighters even if they don't have time to actively manage them day-to-day.

With Contracts you can effectively "loan" out your Fighters for a specific purpose - _while you still maintain ownership of the NFT._

We have plans for the following Contracts - but may add more as the game evolves.

* Fight Contracts - loan your Fighter to another Gym for a specific number of Fights.
* Sparring Contracts - loan your Fighter to another Gym for a specific number of [**Sparring** ](../training-and-sparring.md#sparring)sessions.
* Recruiting Contracts - loan your Fighter to another Gym to [**recruit**](../recruiting.md) a new Fighter on behalf of that Gym.

Cost (and/or share of profits) for Contracts are still TBD
