# ðŸ¤œ Fighting

Fighting is the primary mechanic in the DFC - what's the point in studying the [**Style**](styles-in-progress.md) **** matchups and all that [**Training & Sparring**](training-and-sparring.md) if you don't get to put your Fighters to the test?\
\
First you'll need to pick a Fighter to send into the octagon from your [**Gym**](gym.md) **** page.&#x20;

![Let's send Esther to do battle](<.gitbook/assets/Esther Close Up.png>)

After selecting 'Fight' you'll be taken to your Fighter's current fight organization based on their rank and weight class.

![Choose your opponent wisely!](<.gitbook/assets/Fight Selection.png>)

From this page you can challenge Fighters from other Gyms (or accept a challenge that someone has already sent your way). Once you have found the matchup you like, you lock in your Fighters style for the fight.

![With 24 different styles to choose from - which gives you the best chance to win?](<.gitbook/assets/Style Selection.png>)

Once the opposing Fighter's Gym owner accepts the challenge (or if you're accepting a challenge sent your way) _"ITS TIIIIIIIIIME"_ (queue Bruce Buffer). Both Fighter's Traits, Skills, and Style selection enter as inputs into our proprietary Fight Algorithm to determine a winner. Fighter records and [**Rankings**](rankings.md) are subsequently updated and if any ETH/[**$TKO**](usddfc-in-progress.md) **** was on the line it gets awarded to the winner. We'll give round outputs so you can see how your Fighter stacked up.&#x20;

The Digital Fight Club is beginning as a _**text-based**_ strategy game. You will not see your Fighters fight (at least not yet).
